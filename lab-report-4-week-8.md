## Tests for Snippets

Snippet 1 should produce a list of the links "`google.com", "google.com", and "ucsd.edu".

JUnit output of my implementation: ![snippet1junit](/assets/week-8-images/image1.png)

Snippet 2 should produce a list of the links "a.com(())" and "example.com".

JUnit output of my implementation: ![snippet2junit](/assets/week-8-images/image3.png)

Snippet 3 should produce a list of the links "https://www.twitter.com", "https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/cse-15l-spring-2022/schedule", and "https://cse.ucsd.edu/".

## Snippet Questions
Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
