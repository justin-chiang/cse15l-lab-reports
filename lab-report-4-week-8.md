## Snippet 1

Snippet 1 should produce a list of the links "`google.com", "google.com", and "ucsd.edu".
JUnit test for both my implementation and implementation I am reviewing (same in both test files):
![JUnit test snippet 1](assets/week-8-images/snippet1-image1.png)

Output for my implementation:
![My Junit output snippet 1](assets/week-8-images/snippet1-image2.png)

Output for implementation I am reviewing:
![Review Junit output snippet 1](assets/week-8-images/snippet1-image3.png)

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.


## Snippet 2

Snippet 2 should produce a list of the links "a.com(())" and "example.com".
JUnit test for both my implementation and implementation I am reviewing (same in both test files):
![JUnit test snippet 2](assets/week-8-images/snippet2-image1.png)

Output for my implementation:
![My Junit output snippet 2](assets/week-8-images/snippet2-image2.png)

Output for implementation I am reviewing:
![Review Junit output snippet 2](assets/week-8-images/snippet2-image3.png)

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

## Snippet 3

Snippet 3 should produce a list of the links "https://www.twitter.com", "https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/cse-15l-spring-2022/schedule", and "https://cse.ucsd.edu/".
JUnit test for both my implementation and implementation I am reviewing (same in both test files):
![JUnit test snippet 3](assets/week-8-images/snippet3-image1.png)

Output for my implementation:
![My Junit output snippet 3](assets/week-8-images/snippet3-image2.png)

Output for implementation I am reviewing:
![Review Junit output snippet 33](assets/week-8-images/snippet3-image3.png)

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
