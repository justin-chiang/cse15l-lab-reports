## Remotely Connecting
To remotely connect to your CSE 15L course-specific account on ieng6, we will utilize the Secure Shell protocol (ssh). Type `ssh <your-account-name>@ieng6.ucsd.edu` into Terminal, which will then prompt you to enter your account password. If you're connecting for the first time, it may ask if you want to continue connecting; enter yes. After entering your password, you should see an output similar to the following:

## Trying Some Commands
Once connected to the ieng6 server, you can try some commands in Terminal. Some useful commands include:

* `ls` - lists all files in working directory
* `cd <target-dir>` - changes directory to target directory
* `mkdir <new-dir>` - makes a new directory
* `pwd` - outputs the working directory

Here is a screenshot of some example commands:
